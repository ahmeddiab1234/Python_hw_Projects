## üöÄ Course Flow: From Scratch to High-Level Projects

1. **Starting from Scratch**:  
   Each homework assignment begins with basic Python concepts‚Äîvariables, data types, loops, and functions. You will gradually work towards more complex tasks like object-oriented programming, file handling, and working with libraries like NumPy and Pandas.  

2. **Intermediate Level**:  
   As you progress, you will dive into topics like algorithms, data structures, exception handling, and interacting with APIs. You‚Äôll build a strong understanding of Python‚Äôs standard library and third-party libraries to automate tasks, manipulate data, and solve real-world problems.

3. **High-Level Projects**:  
   Once you have a solid grasp of the fundamentals, the intensive projects will put your skills to the test. These projects will be focused on building full applications from start to finish. Here are the key projects you'll work on:

   - **Ask Form Project**:  
     A project where you create an interactive form in Python, collecting user input, validating it, and displaying a custom response. This will help you develop skills in data handling, user input processing, and form management.

   - **Library Project**:  
     This project involves building a library management system. You'll implement features like book borrowing, return, tracking users, and managing a catalog of books. You'll focus on object-oriented design, file handling, and basic CRUD operations.

   - **Hospital Project**:  
     A hospital management system project where you‚Äôll handle appointments, patient records, staff management, and billing. This project will help you understand database integration, scheduling systems, and implementing real-time features.

   - **Expedia Project**:  
     In this project, you'll work on an online travel booking system. You'll build a search and booking system for hotels, flights, and rental cars. This will help you gain hands-on experience with APIs, data retrieval, and building user-friendly interfaces.

   - **Payroll Project**:  
     This project is focused on creating an automated payroll system. You‚Äôll develop a solution for calculating salaries, taxes, and employee deductions, and generate payroll reports. It will enhance your skills in working with financial data, report generation, and automation.

4. **Building Strong Implementation & Project Skills**:  
   The projects are designed not only to implement solutions but to do so in an efficient, scalable, and maintainable way. You'll be guided on best practices in coding, debugging, and testing, which will enable you to handle real-world programming challenges.
